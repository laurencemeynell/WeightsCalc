 * 
 * When run WeightsCalc will ask the user from the command line to input
 * the weight of their bar.  The it asks for the number and weights of the 
 * plates owned.  Then it asks for a target weight and performs the calculation.
 * 
 * If the user doesn't have the required plates to meet their target it shall warn them
 * and suggest a configuration that will get them as near as possible to their target.
